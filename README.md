The Wave Analyzer Application is a comprehensive audio analysis tool designed for processing and manipulating wave files. It provides a wide range of functionalities including file management, audio visualization, editing, and advanced analysis features.

Features
--------
1. File Management: Open existing wave files or create new ones, and save wave files under a new name.
2. Audio Visualization: Display the wave file graphically and view its detailed header information.
3. Editing Capabilities: Basic audio editing functions including cut, copy, and paste.
4. Audio Playback: Play the wave file within the application.
5. Zoom Functionality: Zoom in and out for a detailed analysis of the wave file.
6. Audio Configuration: Choose between 8-bit and 16-bit audio, and select mono or stereo formats.
7. Sample Rates: Options to select from three different sample rates.
8. Threading Options: Multiple threading options with performance benchmarking.
9. Windowing Styles: Three styles of windowing for detailed audio analysis.
10. DFT and Filtering: Feature to apply Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and various filters for advanced audio processing.

System Requirements
--------------------
- Operating System: Windows 7 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
- Sound card and speakers or headphones for audio playback

Installation
-------------
1. Extract the contents of the downloaded package.
2. Run the setup executable file and follow the on-screen instructions.

Usage
------
1. Launch the Wave Analyzer Application.
2. Use the 'File' menu to open, create, or save wave files.
3. Utilize the graphical interface to view and edit wave files.
4. Access various features like zoom, sample rate selection, and DFT through the options panel.

To-Do After Demo
------
1. Read me of all changes post check and how to run
2. More welcoming start? Not sure if being sarcastic
3. X-axis to seconds.
4. Click and drag for the filters instead of just clicking
5. Need a big zero line for the middle of the DFT
6. Fix DFT reloading window when using filter.
6. Read 16bit files for selectable sample rate. (16bit reading is quantization)
7. cut/copy/paste with stereo
8. Save 16bit
9. playing in different programs
10. More performance, Use a floating point version or an mmx equivalent, switch to x86 and benchmark.
